# Client Side Tooling

Launchpad comes with an opinionated set of tools on your local machine, layered over one another to provide a declarative workflow through all the layers of your infrastructure.

![Client Side Stack](/img/launchpad-client-side-stack.svg)

These tools do not run on your servers, but on your local machine. They form the command & control center that you use to send instructions to your cluster of servers.

## Installing on your local machine

Launchpad comes with a task to install local dependencies on your machine. See the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start) for more information.
