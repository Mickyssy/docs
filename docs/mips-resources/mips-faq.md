# MIPs FAQs

## Is it possible to generate a valid proof of indexing (POI) even if a subgraph has failed? 

Yes, it is indeed.

For context, the arbitration charter, [learn more about the charter here](https://hackmd.io/@4Ln8SAS4RX-505bIHZTeRw/BJcHzpHDu#Abstract), specifies the methodology for generating a POI for a failed subgraph.

A community member, [SunTzu](https://github.com/suntzu93), has created a script to automate this process in compliance with the arbitration charter's methodology. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/suntzu93/get_valid_poi_subgraph).
