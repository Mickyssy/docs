## Highlights of the Workshop

**Why Launchpad?**

Launchpad is designed to meet tomorrow’s needs. It provides a strong foundation for long-term multi-chain indexing and encodes our beliefs and principles about how large-scale infrastructure should be architected and operated.

**What is Launchpad?**

An opinionated set of tools on your local machine, layered over one
another to provide a declarative workflow through all the layers of your infrastructure.

An opinionated stack of software running on your host machines, orchestrated with Kubernetes, providing core cluster functionality, and everything you need to run a scalable Indexer on the Graph’s Decentralised Network.

The core of Launchpad consists of 2 repositories: launchpad-starter and launchpad-core. Another public repository indexers should run is helm-charts.
