## Highlights of the Workshop

- **Allocating to Subgraphs**
    - Primary considerations when selecting subgraphs to allocate to:
        - Indexing difficulty/cost
        - Indexing Rewards revenue
        - Potential query revenue
    - There are various community tools and spreadsheets available within the ecosystem to optimize allocations.
    - Allocating to subgraphs with a low proportionate stake to proportionate signal ratio will result in higher indexing rewards returns.
- **Attracting Delegation**
    - Delegation allows an Indexer to generate additional revenue
    - To get more delegations:
        - Be helpful in the community and build a reputation. Get involved in [IOH](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ7G_cCufIVUdUUUf-jdoVA), [The Graph Discord](https://discord.gg/jcSZGwC3Pw), [Community Talk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCps-lu58cUfdcZoa8VWsfEw/videos), [AdvocatesDAO](https://discord.gg/X8yM8zHnsr)
        - Set competitive indexing reward and query fee cuts
        - Perform well as an Indexer
        - Respectful marketing within Delegator communities such as [The Graph Discord](https://discord.gg/jcSZGwC3Pw) and [Graphtronauts](https://graphtronauts.com/#/)
