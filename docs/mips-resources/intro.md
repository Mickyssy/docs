# Introduction

It's an exciting time to be participating in The Graph ecosystem! During [Graph Day 2022](https://thegraph.com/graph-day/2022/) Yaniv Tal announced the [sunsetting of the hosted service](https://thegraph.com/blog/sunsetting-hosted-service/), a moment The Graph ecosystem has been working towards for many years. 

To support the sunsetting of the hosted service and the migration of all of it's activity to the decentralized network, The Graph Foundation has announced the [Migration Infrastructure Providers (MIPs) program](https://thegraph.com/blog/mips-multi-chain-indexing-incentivized-program).

The MIPs program is an incentivization program for Indexers to support them with resources to index chains beyond Ethereum mainnet and help The Graph protocol expand the decentralized network into a multi-chain infrastructure layer.

The MIPs program has allocated 0.75% of the GRT supply (75M GRT), with 0.5% to reward Indexers who contribute to bootstrapping the network and 0.25% allocated to migration grants for subgraph developers using multi-chain subgraphs.
